# MatLab-Feed-Forward-NN
Simple test of matlab neural networks. The problem is as follows: we have position parameters of radio source measured by multipoint radio system and 
we want to get coordinates of radio sorce. The transformation connecting coordinates of sorce with measured position parameters is non-linear and
leads to solve the system of non-linear equations that hard. Using neral networks we can reduce computational cost and even improve accuracy.
